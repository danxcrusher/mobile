## Differences from Satoshi Coin

| Feature | Mobile App | Satoshi Coin |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **UI Design** | ✅ Mobile-first, beautiful | ✅ Simple, functional |
| **Features** | ✅ Send/Receive/Convert/Water | ✅ Coin flip game |
| **Wallet Integration** | ✅ Same approach | ✅ Same approach |
| **Network** | ✅ Testnet default | ✅ Localnet default |

## Next Steps

1. **Test Real Connection**: Connect an actual Sui wallet
2. **Get Testnet SUI**: Use faucet to get test tokens
3. **Test Transactions**: Try sending/receiving on testnet
4. **Deploy to Production**: Switch to mainnet when ready

The mobile app now uses the same robust wallet integration approach as the satoshi coin project while maintaining its unique features and beautiful UI design.
